## 🎯 Phase 1: Understand the Framework

### Start Here: Core Concepts

**New to Team Topologies?** Start with the **[Quick Reference Guide](docs/01-quick-reference.md)** for essential team types and interaction modes.

**Ready for depth?** Read the **[Team Topologies Guide](docs/02-team-topologies-guide.md)** to understand:
- **4 Team Types**: Stream-Aligned, Platform, Enabling, Complicated Subsystem
- **3 Interaction Modes**: Collaboration, X-as-a-Service, Facilitating
- **Enterprise Challenges**: Cognitive load, flow optimization, cross-BU dependencies

### Key Questions to Answer:
- What team types do we likely have?
- Where are our biggest cross-business-unit friction points?
- What platform services are duplicated across business units?

2. **[Targeted Interviews](team-topology-interview-guide.md)** → 5-10 strategic interviews to validate survey insights
3. **[Dependency Mapping](dependency-mapping-canvas.md)** → Data-driven visualization based on survey responses
4. **[Optional Workshop](workshop-facilitation-guide.md)** → Single cross-BU validation workshop if needed

#### ⚡ **Option B: Pilot Assessment (Quick Start)**
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks | **Coverage**: 5-8 teams | **Effort**: Low | **Accuracy**: Good

1. **Pilot Survey** → Deploy survey to representative teams across business units
2. **Validation Interviews** → 3-5 interviews with pilot team leads
3. **Data Analysis** → Apply scoring framework to pilot data

### Assessment Execution Guide

#### **Week 1-2: Survey Deployment & Promotion**
- Deploy **[Enterprise Survey](team-topology-assessment-survey.md)** organization-wide
- **Executive messaging** and follow-up to achieve 85%+ response rate
- **Pro Tip**: Use the **[Google Forms Setup Guide](google-forms-setup-guide.md)** for easy distribution and tracking
- **Survey monitoring**: Daily response rate tracking and targeted follow-ups

#### **Week 3-4: Survey Analysis & Pattern Identification**
- Apply **[Enterprise Scoring Framework](scoring-analysis-framework.md)** to survey responses
- Identify patterns, red flags, and areas requiring deeper investigation
- Generate preliminary team classifications and cross-BU dependency maps

#### **Week 5-8: Targeted Validation Interviews**
- Conduct **[Strategic Interviews](team-topology-interview-guide.md)** with 5-10 key stakeholders
- Focus on validating survey findings and exploring unexpected patterns
- Target teams with unclear classifications or high cross-BU dependencies

#### **Week 9-10: Optional Validation Workshop**
- **Only if needed**: Run single **[Cross-BU Workshop](workshop-facilitation-guide.md)** to validate major findings
- Focus on highest-impact cross-BU dependencies and platform consolidation opportunities
- 3-4 hours with 8-12 key representatives from across business units
