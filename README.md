#### Assessment Execution
1. **Deploy Survey** to all teams (aim for 80%+ response rate)
2. **Conduct Interviews** with team leads and key members
3. **Run Collaborative Workshop** for cross-team perspective
4. **Complete Dependency Mapping** for complex relationships

#### Analysis & Planning
- **Team Classification**: Apply scoring framework to determine team types
- **Health Assessment**: Identify red flags and improvement opportunities
- **Gap Analysis**: Compare current state to target Team Topologies model
- **Roadmap Creation**: Develop prioritized implementation plan

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (Months 4-6)

#### Pilot Team Selection
**Choose 3-4 representative teams for initial implementation:**
- 1 Platform team (high-value service with clear customers)
- 1-2 Stream-Aligned teams (direct value delivery focus)
- 1 Enabling team (if available, for knowledge transfer validation)

#### Pilot Execution
- **Team Structure Optimization**: Adjust team boundaries and responsibilities
- **Interaction Pattern Design**: Implement recommended interaction modes
- **Tool & Process Standardization**: Deploy supporting infrastructure
- **Metrics Implementation**: Establish measurement and tracking systems

#### Success Validation
- **Flow Metrics**: Track lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate
- **Team Health**: Monitor cognitive load, autonomy, and satisfaction scores
- **Business Impact**: Measure time-to-market and quality improvements
- **Lessons Learned**: Document what works and what needs adjustment

### Phase 3: Scale & Standardize (Months 7-12)
