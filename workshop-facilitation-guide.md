## Workshop Agenda

### Opening (30 minutes)

#### Welcome & Introductions (10 minutes)
**Facilitator Script:**
"Welcome everyone. Today we're going to collaboratively map how our teams work together and identify opportunities to improve our effectiveness. This is about understanding our current reality, not judging whether it's right or wrong."

#### Team Topologies Overview (20 minutes)
**Content to Cover:**
- 4 team types with examples
- 3 interaction modes with examples
- Conway's Law and cognitive load concepts
- Visual examples from other organizations

**Interactive Element:**
- Quick poll: "Which team type do you think your team is?"
- Note responses without discussion

---

### Exercise 1: Team Identity Mapping (45 minutes)

#### Setup (5 minutes)
- Divide into team groups (1 facilitator per 3-4 teams)
- Provide each team with dependency mapping canvas
- Explain the exercise goal

#### Team Canvas Completion (30 minutes)
**Instructions:**
"Complete sections 1-3 of your dependency mapping canvas:
1. Core team information
2. Upstream dependencies
3. Downstream dependencies

Focus on facts, not opinions. Use specific examples."

**Facilitator Role:**
- Circulate between teams
- Ask clarifying questions
- Help teams stay factual
- Note interesting patterns

#### Gallery Walk (10 minutes)
- Teams post their canvases on walls
- Silent review of all other teams' canvases
- Participants note questions or observations

---

### Exercise 2: Interaction Mode Analysis (40 minutes)

#### Interaction Mapping (25 minutes)
**Setup:**
Create large wall map with:
- Teams as circles (use team names)
- Interaction lines between teams
- Color coding for interaction modes:
  - Red = Collaboration (high touch)
  - Blue = X-as-a-Service (low touch)
  - Green = Facilitating (knowledge transfer)

**Instructions:**
"Working together, let's map all the significant team interactions. For each connection:
1. Draw a line between teams
2. Choose the color that best represents how you work together
3. Add thickness to show frequency (thick = daily, medium = weekly, thin = monthly)"

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Start with one team and build outward
- Encourage discussion about interaction mode choices
- Note disagreements for later discussion
- Ask "How does this actually work in practice?"

#### Pattern Identification (15 minutes)
**Group Discussion:**
- What patterns do you see?
- Where are the heaviest interaction loads?
- Which teams have the most connections?
- What surprises you about this map?

### Break (15 minutes)

### Exercise 3: Team Type Classification (45 minutes)

#### Individual Classification (15 minutes)
**Materials:** Colored sticky notes (one color per team type)

**Instructions:**
"Using the colored sticky notes:
- Pink = Stream-Aligned
- Blue = Platform
- Green = Enabling
- Yellow = Complicated Subsystem

Place your team's sticky note in the quadrant where you think your team best fits. You can place it between quadrants if you're unsure."

**Facilitator Setup:**
Create large 2x2 grid on wall with team type definitions in each quadrant.

#### Group Discussion & Calibration (30 minutes)
**Process:**
1. **Review placements** (10 minutes)
   - Note clusters and outliers
   - Ask teams to briefly explain their placement

2. **Challenge and discuss** (15 minutes)
   - Focus on teams placed between quadrants
   - Ask other teams: "Do you agree with this placement?"
   - Discuss conflicting perspectives

3. **Final calibration** (5 minutes)
   - Teams can move their sticky notes based on discussion
   - Note any teams that remain unclear

**Facilitator Questions:**
- "What evidence supports this classification?"
- "How does this team actually deliver value?"
- "Who are their real customers?"
- "What would happen if this team disappeared?"

### Exercise 4: Pain Point Identification (30 minutes)

#### Dot Voting on Issues (15 minutes)
**Setup:**
Create categories on wall:
- Communication delays
- Unclear responsibilities
- Technology conflicts
- Process bottlenecks
- Knowledge gaps
- Other

**Process:**
1. Teams write pain points on sticky notes (5 minutes)
2. Place notes in appropriate categories (5 minutes)
3. Dot voting on most impactful issues (5 minutes)

#### Root Cause Discussion (15 minutes)
**Focus on top 5 voted issues:**
- What's the underlying cause?
- Which teams are affected?
- What would good look like?
- Quick win opportunities?

---

### Exercise 5: Future State Design (25 minutes)

#### Ideal Interaction Design (20 minutes)
**Instructions:**
"Looking at our current interaction map, what would you change to reduce friction and improve effectiveness? Work in pairs to redesign the interaction between your teams."

**Facilitator Role:**
- Encourage specific changes, not vague improvements
- Ask about trade-offs and implementation challenges
- Note common themes across redesigns

#### Share Back (5 minutes)
- Quick reports from each pair
- Focus on specific changes and rationale

---

### Closing & Next Steps (20 minutes)

#### Key Insights Summary (10 minutes)
**Facilitator leads group discussion:**
- What were the biggest surprises?
- What patterns are most concerning?
- What opportunities are most exciting?
- What would be the highest impact changes?

#### Action Planning (10 minutes)
**Immediate next steps:**
1. Finalize team classifications (within 1 week)
2. Detailed analysis of survey + workshop data (within 2 weeks)
3. Individual team feedback sessions (within 1 month)
4. Organization-wide recommendations (within 6 weeks)

**Commitment ask:**
- Teams commit to participate in follow-up interviews
- Leaders commit to reviewing and acting on recommendations

## Facilitation Best Practices

### Creating Psychological Safety
- Emphasize "current reality" vs "ideal state"
- Avoid blame language
- Acknowledge that all team types are valuable
- Encourage honest discussion about challenges

### Managing Dynamics
- **Dominant participants**: Use time limits and structured formats
- **Quiet participants**: Small group work before large group sharing
- **Disagreements**: Frame as different perspectives, both valid
- **Off-topic discussions**: "Parking lot" for issues to address later

### Keeping Energy High
- Vary between individual, small group, and large group activities
- Use physical movement (gallery walks, wall mapping)
- Take breaks when energy drops
- Celebrate insights and "aha moments"

### Handling Resistance
- **"Our team is unique"**: Acknowledge uniqueness while finding patterns
- **"These categories don't fit"**: Explore why and adapt if needed
- **"This won't change anything"**: Focus on understanding current state first
- **"We already know this"**: Ask for specific evidence and examples

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Participation
**Symptoms**: Teams not engaging, surface-level responses
**Solutions**:
- Pair teams with natural collaborators
- Ask for specific examples and stories
- Use smaller breakout groups
- Share anonymous survey insights to spark discussion

### Conflict Over Classifications
**Symptoms**: Teams strongly disagree on types or interactions
**Solutions**:
- Focus on observed behaviors vs intentions
- Use "both/and" thinking - teams can have multiple aspects
- Table contentious classifications for follow-up interviews
- Emphasize learning over being "right"

### Information Overload
**Symptoms**: Participants overwhelmed by complexity
**Solutions**:
- Focus on one relationship at a time
- Use simple visual tools
- Take more breaks
- Summarize frequently

### Scope Creep
**Symptoms**: Discussion moves to organizational design or strategy
**Solutions**:
- Redirect to current state assessment
- Use parking lot for future topics
- Remind of workshop goals
- Schedule separate sessions for design discussions
