## Conway's Law Considerations and Architectural Alignment {#conways-law-considerations}

### Understanding Conway's Law Impact

**Conway's Law:** "Organizations which design systems... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

### Current Architecture Implications

Our team structure will naturally influence our system architecture:

#### Positive Alignments
- **Model Registry Team** → **Centralized Model Catalog Service**
- **Stream-Aligned ML Teams** → **Independent ML Services**
- **Platform Teams** → **Shared Infrastructure Services**

#### Potential Misalignments to Address
- **Cross-Team Dependencies** → **Tightly Coupled Systems**
- **Unclear Ownership** → **Monolithic Components**
- **Communication Gaps** → **Integration Challenges**

### Architectural Patterns to Encourage

#### 1. Service-Oriented Architecture
- Each team owns well-defined services
- Clear API contracts between services
- Independent deployment capabilities

#### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Loose coupling between team boundaries
- Asynchronous communication patterns
- Reduced direct dependencies

#### 3. Domain-Driven Design
- Team boundaries align with business domains
- Clear domain ownership and responsibility
- Minimal cross-domain dependencies
