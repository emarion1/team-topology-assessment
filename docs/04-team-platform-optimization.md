# Team & Platform Optimization

> **Attribution Notice**: Based on Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais (IT Revolution Press, 2019)

## Overview

This section focuses on optimizing team structures, platform services, and organizational effectiveness. These optimizations build upon the cognitive load and flow improvements to create high-performing, autonomous teams.

## 1. Platform Service Optimization

### Service Design Principles

#### User Experience Focus
- **Customer Journey Mapping:** For each platform service
- **Usability Testing:** Regular testing with internal customers
- **Feedback Integration:** Systematic collection and implementation

- **SLA Definition and Monitoring:**
  - Availability targets (99.5% minimum for critical services)
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Customer satisfaction metrics

- **Capacity Management:**
  - Predictive scaling based on usage patterns
  - Resource optimization and cost management
  - Performance testing and optimization

### Platform Evolution Strategy

#### Capability Maturity Model
- **Level 1 - Basic:** Manual processes, reactive support
- **Level 2 - Managed:** Automated monitoring, proactive support
- **Level 3 - Defined:** Self-service capabilities, clear SLAs
- **Level 4 - Quantitatively Managed:** Data-driven optimization
- **Level 5 - Optimizing:** Continuous improvement, innovation

#### Service Portfolio Management
- **Service Lifecycle:**
  - Incubation: Proof of concept and validation
  - Growth: Feature development and adoption
  - Maturity: Optimization and stability
  - Sunset: Migration and retirement planning

### Platform Team Specific Optimizations

#### Service Catalog Enhancement
- **Self-Service Portal:** Web-based interface for service discovery and requests
- **Service Documentation:** Comprehensive guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting
- **Cost Transparency:** Clear pricing models for internal services

#### Capacity Management
- **Demand Forecasting:** Predictive analytics for service usage
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Automated resource allocation based on demand
- **Queue Management:** Intelligent prioritization of service requests

## 2. Organizational Structure Optimization

### Team Size and Composition

#### Optimal Team Sizes
- **Stream-Aligned Teams:** 5-9 members ("two pizza teams")
- **Platform Teams:** 8-12 members (can be larger due to service scope)
- **Enabling Teams:** 3-6 members (small, focused on knowledge transfer)
- **Complicated-Subsystem Teams:** 5-10 members (specialized expertise)

#### Composition Guidelines
- **Cross-Functional Requirements:**
  - Each team has all skills needed for their domain
  - Minimize dependencies on other teams for day-to-day work
  - Include product ownership capability in Stream-Aligned teams

- **Stability Factors:**
  - Team members stay together for minimum 12-18 months
  - Gradual team changes (no more than 1-2 people per quarter)
  - Preserve team knowledge and working relationships

### Architecture-Organization Alignment

#### Service Boundaries
- **Align with Team Boundaries:** Each team owns well-defined services
- **API Design:** Reflect team interaction patterns
- **Data Ownership:** Clear assignment to specific teams

#### Inverse Conway Maneuver
- **Design Target Architecture:** Before reorganizing teams
- **Align Teams to Architecture:** Structure teams to produce desired architecture
- **Iterate and Refine:** Continuously adjust based on results
