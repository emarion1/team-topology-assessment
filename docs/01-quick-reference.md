## The Four Fundamental Team Types

| Team Type | Purpose | Size | Primary Focus | Interaction Mode |
|-----------|---------|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Stream-Aligned** | Deliver continuous flow of value to customers | 5-9 | End-to-end value delivery | Minimal dependencies |
| **Platform** | Reduce cognitive load by providing services | 8-12 | Internal service provision | X-as-a-Service |
| **Enabling** | Help teams adopt new technologies/practices | 3-6 | Knowledge transfer | Facilitating (time-bounded) |
| **Complicated-Subsystem** | Build/maintain specialized systems | 5-10 | Deep technical expertise | X-as-a-Service |

## The Three Team Interaction Modes

### 1. Collaboration ü§ù
- **When**: Discovery, rapid learning, new problem spaces
- **Duration**: Temporary (weeks to months)
- **Communication**: Daily standups, shared planning, joint retrospectives
- **Success**: Knowledge transferred, dependency reduced

### 2. X-as-a-Service üõ†Ô∏è
- **When**: Well-defined, stable capabilities needed by multiple teams
- **Duration**: Long-term
- **Communication**: Service catalogs, tickets, SLA monitoring
- **Success**: High availability, clear SLAs, minimal cognitive load

### 3. Facilitating üéØ
- **When**: Teams need help adopting new practices/technologies
- **Duration**: Short-term (weeks to few months)
- **Communication**: Structured engagements, knowledge artifacts, follow-up
- **Success**: Team becomes self-sufficient, practice adopted

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Over-collaboration**: Too much time in meetings vs. delivering value
- **Chronic collaboration**: Long-term collaboration that should be X-as-a-Service
- **Multiple dependencies**: Stream-Aligned teams depending on many other teams
- **Unclear boundaries**: Teams not knowing what services others provide
- **Ping-pong interactions**: Work bouncing between teams due to unclear ownership

## Recommended Agile Approaches by Team Type

| Team Type | Framework | Key Features | Sprint Length |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Stream-Aligned** | Scrum-ban Hybrid | Customer feedback loops, adaptive planning | 2 weeks |
| **Platform** | Kanban + SLOs | Continuous flow, service level objectives | Continuous |
| **Enabling** | Engagement Kanban | Project-based, knowledge transfer focus | Engagement-based |
| **Complicated-Subsystem** | Modified Scrum | Technical focus, longer cycles | 3-4 weeks |

## Key Success Metrics by Team Type

### Stream-Aligned Teams
- **Flow**: Lead time <2 weeks, daily deployments
- **Quality**: <5% change failure rate
- **Value**: Direct customer impact metrics

### Platform Teams
- **Service**: 99.5% availability, <5 day lead time
- **Satisfaction**: Internal customer NPS >7
- **Efficiency**: Self-service adoption rate

### Enabling Teams
- **Transfer**: >85% engagement success rate
- **Knowledge**: Post-engagement assessment scores
- **Capacity**: 2-3 concurrent engagements max

### Complicated-Subsystem Teams
- **Technical**: Performance benchmarks met
- **Integration**: Consuming team satisfaction
- **Innovation**: R&D milestones achieved
